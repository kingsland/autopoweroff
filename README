Just tested on gdm3 lightdm desktop env like
ubuntu 18 ubuntu 20 redhat7.5 Kylin-4.0.2 Kylin-V10 NeoKylin

This scripts need zenity!!

Run this scripts will remove login interface, sudo password.
Although, these settings will restore when you stop running.
I shell still warnning you about that.
If you don't mind, just run it by command ./autopoweroff
with or without sudo. Also you can just click it.
